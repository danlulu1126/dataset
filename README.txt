# Introduction

The catalog contains a dataset of rider's helmet wearing detection. First, the images were obtained through web crawlers and taken in the field at several locations such as pedestrian Bridges. A total of more than 500 network pictures and more than 2000 self-taken pictures were collected, and three types of original data including electric vehicles and riders, the heads of riders wearing helmets and those without helmets were labeled. Dataset was expanded by data enhancement methods to build a helmet wearing dataset of riders containing more than 14,000 images, and the training set and test set were divided. In addition, there are 30,449 motor labels, 16,071 helmet labels, and 14,482 head labels. Helmet and head labels are evenly distributed, with diverse samples and rich backgrounds, and different target sizes, among which small targets account for a larger proportion.


# Description

The dataset is mainly used for helmet detection of road riders, promoting the effective implementation of the "One helmet Belt" policy, and adopting intelligent detection algorithms for problems such as the difficulty of manual inspection at intersections and the difficulty of full time coverage, so as to efficiently supervise the helmet wearing problems of cyclists. The directory is divided into training set, test set, category files and readme document. The original file and image enhanced file are placed respectively in the dataset to facilitate comparison between the two effects, and the picture, labels and category files are uniformly corresponding. This dataset is labeled in yolo format and output txt text. In addition, the image enhancement code is placed in the file, which is convenient for us to expand the data set in the case of small data set, and enhance the ability to detect the target. You can read the readme documentation to learn more about the dataset.
